# VisAid-FISTA
Visual aid for understanding and analyzing changes after FISTA iterations

FISTA offers pretty fast iterations in comparison to the ISTA algorithm due to the difference in order of computation complexity. A variant of gradient descent, it is important to understand how the steps are being taken after each iteration.

The module is meant to be a plugin file to be used anywhere required with the proper parameters specified.
